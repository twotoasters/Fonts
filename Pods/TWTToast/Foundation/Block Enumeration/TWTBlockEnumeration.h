 @abstract Return a newly created collection that is the result of performing the given block on each

 @discussion Given a collection of [1, 2, 3] and a block that returns the square of the element, this
    method will return [1, 4, 9]. If the result of the block is nil, that element in the resulting
    collection will be the NSNull instance. If the collection is a dictionary the item passed to
    the block is the key.

     element in the resulting collection will be the NSNull instance. If the collection is a dictionary the item
     passed to the block is the key. The values in the resulting dictionary are the type of the receiver except
     when the receiver is an NSEnumerator, in which case it is an array.

 @discussion Similar to a "reduce" operation. For each item in the collection, the memo value
    and the item is passed to the block. The return value from each iteration is the memo value for
    the next iteration. For the first iteration, the initial object is passed as the memo. For example, 
    given a collection of [1, 2, 3], a block that returns (memo + element), and an initial value of 0
    the returned value will be the result of (0 + 1) then (1 + 2) then (3 + 3) or 6. If the collection
    is a dictionary the item passed to the block is the key.
 @param initialObject The initial object to pass as a memo to the first iteration of the collection.
 @param block An inject block that is performed on each element of the collection.
 @result The final returned value from the last iteration of the collection.
